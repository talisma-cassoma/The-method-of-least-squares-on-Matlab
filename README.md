# what for?
if you have a set of data

Did you know that in math it is possible to find a function
which produces its same set of data regardless of how they are arranged?

so yes! using The method of least squares we can do it, we can predict what are the next sequence values or any other values
of a data set

this code is the application of that math methode, you can try it for and see it

***General Introduction***

Being able to draw conclusions about data trends is one of the most important steps in business and science.
Often, the questions we ask ourselves force us to make predictions.This projet describes a
relationship between time spent reviewing and grade, we try to mathematically generate a function that describes the behavior
of notes as a function of time. Of course, this example is not as realistic as it is claimed because in reality
there are other factors envolved, such as the quality of the student etc, etc , but we will ignore factors of
confusion like this for now and work a simple example.
Everyone already knows that there is a positive relationship between time spent reviewing and grade.
that we get, but we're going to need some data to demonstrate it correctly.
